# Machine Learning From Scratch 

This repository contains **Machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch**
using **Python and NumPy only** — without using high-level ML libraries such as
scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

The goal of this repository is to **deeply understand how ML algorithms work
internally**, including the mathematics, optimization, and learning process.

## 🎯 Why This Repository?

Most ML libraries hide the internal logic.
This repo focuses on:

- Understanding **math behind ML**
- Writing **core algorithms manually**
- Learning **gradient descent and optimization**
- Building intuition for **neural networks**

This project is designed for:
- ML & AI beginners
- Strong foundation building
